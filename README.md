# 3D Portfolio

A personal 3D portfolio website built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS and React Three Fiber (Three.js).

This repository contains a small single-page portfolio showcasing interactive 3D canvas components, projects, and contact information.

## Features

- Interactive 3D canvas scenes (Earth, Computer, Ball, Stars)
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Animated sections with Framer Motion
- Modular React components for easy editing

## Tech stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Three Fiber / Three.js
- Framer Motion

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (or pnpm / yarn)

## Quick start (development)

Run these commands in the project root:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser (Vite will print the actual host/port).

## Build & preview

```bash
# build for production
npm run build

# preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

If your `package.json` uses different script names, update the commands accordingly.

## Project structure (high level)

- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/` — React source
	- `main.jsx` — application bootstrap
	- `App.jsx` — top-level app component
	- `components/` — UI sections and canvas components (`canvas/` holds 3D scenes)
	- `assets/` — images, textures, and icons
	- `constants/`, `hoc/`, `utils/` — helpers and wrappers
- `public/` — static files (includes some asset licenses)

## Licenses & credits

Some textures and assets include license files under `public/desktop_pc/` and `public/planet/`. Please review those before re-using assets.

Consider adding a root `LICENSE` file (e.g. MIT) to make repository licensing explicit.

## Deployment

This is a static site generated by Vite. You can deploy the `dist/` output to providers such as Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
